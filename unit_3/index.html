        <h1>It's coffee time!</h1>
        <h2>Back in 2010, the two founders of a young Swiss start-up visited our Montreux office to present us a brand new way of communicating with our target audience. Their spirit was close to ours and we were seduced by their concept it was the start of a fruitful collaboration</h2>
        <p>Imagine yourself in the shoes of a university student. You are on your morning break and of course you are a bit tired because you spent most of your night studying, partying might even be more likely! So you make your way to the cafeteria to get this caffeine boost that will help you get through the day. Surprise! Your coffee cup catches your attention because of its vivid colours so while drinking your brew, your eyes are drawn to the catchy content of that very unusual cup. 
        Since the piece is not only appealing but also funny, you show it to your fellow classmates and talk about it until the end of your break. In the end, this leaves you a very positive impression and you enjoyed the whole concept of branded cups, looking forward to your next latte!
        Long story short, this concept of branded cups is really innovative and creative and more than anything else it suits our needs perfectly for the following reasons:
        - It's completely targetable since you can choose the distribution places and when and for how long your campaigns will be running. In our case, we concentrated them on schools, universities and libraries since our main target audience is students.
        - The impact is huge because a coffee cup stays in hands for about 5 minutes giving plenty of time for your target audience to be exposed to your message. Put that in perspective with a press ad or a billboard in the street and you'll get how strong this means of communication is!
        - It allows us to be creative and attractive in both our designs and messages to catch people's attention and make an impression.
        - It's a new concept, which has not been overly used by every company. It gives a positive image from us and makes us stand out from our competitors.
        The last word is that not only we run several times a year successful campaigns through this company, we also developed a solid win win relationship, which lead us to be featured in Bilan, one of the most influential economic magazine in Switzerland among the perks.</p>

        <h1>ESL Roadtrip in France </h1>
        <h2>Since the launch of its new visual identity in late 2014, ESL has been trying to find new ways to reach its audience and refresh its image. Innovating in our communication and marketing: that's exactly what our April 2015 promotional road trip in France was about.</h2>
        <p>ESL has always endeavoured to be as close to its potential clients as possible by meeting them where they are: in schools, in universities, at specialised fairs, in their workplaces, in their cities. Depending on the target audience, the role of the marketing team is to find ways to bring the right message to the right people in the right places. 
        With this in mind, we have been implementing actions to place flyers in various public spaces such as restaurants, caf√©s, bars and shops for years. This means potential clients could get an interest in our services while having a sandwich, drinking tea or looking for a new pair of sunglasses in their favourite hangout!
        When chatting with one of our commercial partners, Magali came up with a fresh idea: what if ESL travelled the roads of France to meet people where they are, in a proactive manner, without waiting for them to come to us? What about a road trip: a VW van, a group of young people and a driver?  
        After 3 months of preparation, involving the training of the staff by Magali in Paris, branding our minibus, preparing a series of goodies (badges, bags) and marketing items (clothes, photocalls), organising a contest for a chance to win an iPad and choosing strategic dates and places, our bus set out on the roads of France for 12 days, stopping successively in Nice, Lyon, Strasbourg, Lille and Paris. 
        During each stop in these big cities, new local staff members took turns to hand out flyers and goodies, and to register passers-by for our contest while informing them about our products. Having a local team on site means we could benefit from their knowledge of the city and park our bus in the most popular and visible spots in the area. In each city, the trained young people were able to answer the questions of the visitors and redirect them towards our local ESL agency. 
        In the end, the benefits were manifold: 90,000 flyers, 3,500 bags and 2,000 badges were distributed in 5 different cities during 12 days, with over 1,000 participants entering our contest! Besides, all of the young people who were trained have the qualities required to become excellent ESL Insiders in the future. So where are we going next?</p>
