        <h1>It's coffee time!</h1>
        <h2>Back in 2010, the two founders of a young Swiss start-up visited our Montreux office to present us a brand new way of communicating with our target audience. Their spirit was close to ours and we were seduced by their concept it was the start of a fruitful collaboration</h2>
        <p>Imagine yourself in the shoes of a university student. You are on your morning break and of course you are a bit tired because you spent most of your night studying, partying might even be more likely! So you make your way to the cafeteria to get this caffeine boost that will help you get through the day. Surprise! Your coffee cup catches your attention because of its vivid colours so while drinking your brew, your eyes are drawn to the catchy content of that very unusual cup.</p>

        <h1>ESL Roadtrip in France </h1>
        <h2>Since the launch of its new visual identity in late 2014, ESL has been trying to find new ways to reach its audience and refresh its image. Innovating in our communication and marketing: that's exactly what our April 2015 promotional road trip in France was about.</h2>
        <p>ESL has always endeavoured to be as close to its potential clients as possible by meeting them where they are: in schools, in universities, at specialised fairs, in their workplaces, in their cities. Depending on the target audience, the role of the marketing team is to find ways to bring the right message to the right people in the right places. 
        With this in mind, we have been implementing actions to place flyers in various public spaces such as restaurants, caf√©s, bars and shops for years. This means potential clients could get an interest in our services while having a sandwich, drinking tea or looking for a new pair of sunglasses in their favourite hangout!</p>
