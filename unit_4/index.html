        <h1>ESL Roadtrip in France </h1>
        <h2>Innovating in our communication and marketing: that's exactly what our April 2015 promotional road trip in France was about.</h2>
        <p>ESL has always endeavoured to be as close to its potential clients as possible by meeting them where they are: in schools, in universities, at specialised fairs, in their workplaces, in their cities. Depending on the target audience, the role of the marketing team is to find ways to bring the right message to the right people in the right places. 
        With this in mind, we have been implementing actions to place flyers in various public spaces such as restaurants, bars and shops for years. This means potential clients could get an interest in our services while having a sandwich, drinking tea or looking for a new pair of sunglasses in their favourite hangout!</p>

        <h1>clement Duay, one of our most multitalented members of staff</h1>
        <h2>My name is Clement. I'm 26 years old and live in the beautiful area of Montreux! I graduated with a Bachelors in Business and Economics last October and recently got a promotion in the Products and Partnerships department.</h2>
        <p>I had three goals. The first was to have a break after I finished my studies. I've always wanted to visit Colombia from the day I met el Señor Javier Perdomo! The time I had over there is indescribable! Que chévere! It's the promised land! I used to have one rule which is "Never travel twice to the same place", but I'm gonna have to break it... Javier is the best host ever! Thank you so much for all the memories! My second personal objective was to improve my English speaking and I spent one month at Kings in Hollywood as an intern, studying in the morning and working in their office in the afternoon. Finally, I wanted to broaden my industry knowledge: to find the differences between schools as well as trends for specific language programs. I had the chance to visit 37 schools and many residences in Canada and the US. It has been the BEST training ever!</p>

        <h1> Business language training changes with the times </h1>
        <h2> When ESL launched the Business Language Training (BLT) line in 2009, Europe was in the early days of a financial crisis that is still being felt today. As the market changes, it's time to update BLT.</h2>
        <p> At Business English UK's annual general meeting in late 2014, one topic was on everybody's lips. How could schools and agencies make one of the most traditional areas of language teaching relevant again? ESL's Krister Weidenhielm had been invited to speak – the first representative from an agency ever to have the honour – and tackled the topic directly. His message was clear. Corporate training budgets have shrunk, the job market has become more competitive and a new kind of customer has emerged, needing a modified product and clearer message.</p>
        <p> Language schools had always targeted older, executive-level clients for business language courses, with company HR departments picking up the bill. As such, the product was adapted especially for these clients, with small class sizes, VIP service and prices to match. This was reflected in the promotional materials produced by schools and agencies, designed to appeal to mature learners who quite possibly enjoyed golf and vintage wine. </p>
        <p> Although language skills can benefit everyone professionally, a certain new demographic has become particularly interested in affordable business language courses. People in the earlier stages of their careers see that language skills can make you stand out among your peers, not just when applying for jobs but also when settled in the workplace. Perhaps in their late 20s or 30s, this student considers the language course a professional investment as much as a fun, cultural experience. </p>
        <p> In Montreux and Barcelona, ESL staff have been working together since the end of 2014 to refresh the content and image of BLT line, making it more relevant and appealing for this shifting audience. </p>
        <p> Courses such as the popular 30+ programmes or General + Business elective have been included in the new and improved BLT package, to broaden its appeal and offer something more directly relevant to people at earlier stages of their careers. The introduction of the new agency websites and company branding last year was a first step towards repositioning the courses, and 2015 will see the launch of a brand new brochure and updated web presence.</p>
        <p> Laure-Elia Sauthier and the design team have been working closely with the Products team on the project. Yolanda Garcia and Laure-Elia recently organised and managed a photoshoot in London and Barcelona, "to communicate spaces and activities in a photogenic way, but also make you want to live this experience" according to Yolanda. "We want young professionals to recognize themselves in these images... I see this client as a more independent student, self-confident, with clear goals."<p>
        <p> By responding early to changes in the market, ESL should be well-positioned to get full benefit from the latest developments in one of the oldest fields of study abroad. Krister describes the result as more "democratic" than the traditional approach to business language courses. With the restructured product line and updated image launching in 2015, this is an exciting time for everyone involved in BLT.</p>
