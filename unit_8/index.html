					<h2>ESL Roadtrip <br> in France</h2>			
					<p>ESL has always endeavoured to be as close to its potential clients as possible by meeting them where they are: in schools, in universities, at specialised fairs, in their workplaces, in their cities. Depending on the target audience, the role of the marketing team is to find ways to bring the right message to the right people in the right places. With this in mind, we have been implementing actions to place flyers in various public spaces such as restaurants, bars and shops for years. This means potential clients could get an interest in our services while having a sandwich, drinking tea or looking for a new pair of sunglasses in their favourite hangout!</p>

	        		<h2>Clement Duay, interview</h2>			
					<p>I had three goals. The first was to have a break after I finished my studies. I've always wanted to visit Colombia from the day I met el Señor Javier Perdomo! The time I had over there is indescribable! Que chévere! It's the promised land! Javier is the best host ever! Thank you so much for all the memories! My second personal objective was to improve my English speaking and I spent one month at Kings in Hollywood as an intern, studying in the morning and working in their office in the afternoon. Finally, I wanted to broaden my industry knowledge: to find the differences between schools as well as trends for specific language programs. I had the chance to visit 37 schools and many residences in Canada and the US. It has been the BEST training ever!</p>

	        		<h2>BLT changes <br> with the times</h2>	      
					<p>In Montreux and Barcelona, ESL staff have been working together since the end of 2014 to refresh the content and image of BLT line, making it more relevant and appealing for this shifting audience. Courses such as the popular 30+ programmes or General + Business elective have been included in the new and improved BLT package, to broaden its appeal and offer something more directly relevant to people at earlier stages of their careers.</p>
