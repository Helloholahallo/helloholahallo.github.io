        <p>ESL has always endeavoured to be as close to its potential clients as possible by meeting them where they are: in schools, in universities, at specialised fairs, in their workplaces, in their cities. Depending on the target audience, the role of the marketing team is to find ways to bring the right message to the right people in the right places. 
        With this in mind, we have been implementing actions to place flyers in various public spaces such as restaurants, bars and shops for years. This means potential clients could get an interest in our services while having a sandwich, drinking tea or looking for a new pair of sunglasses in their favourite hangout!</p>
